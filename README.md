# FaceGAN

This project consists of a GAN that can generate images of human faces.

The dataset used is the [Flickr Faces HQ Dataset](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset) with 70000 high resoltuion images of diverse faces.

The implementation of the model is highly based on [the following project by tkarrass.](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans)

### To run:

Simply run train.py (once it is fully functional).
The project uses Keras, Tensorflow, and the Python Image Library (PIL) as well as numpy and matplotlib.
